# Student Performance EDA using Python

An end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** using Python to analyze student academic performance and identify key factors influencing exam scores.  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, clean and transform datasets, perform structured EDA, and extract meaningful insights using Python.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation & analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Performed initial exploration using:
  - `head()`
  - `info()`
  - `describe()`
  - Null value checks

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed irrelevant columns 
- Fixed inconsistent categorical values
- Standardized string values for accurate grouping and analysis

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Gender Distribution
- Analyzed the distribution of male and female students using count plots

#### Parent Education vs Student Scores
- Used `groupby()` and aggregation to calculate average scores
- Visualized results using heatmaps
- Observed strong correlation between higher parent education and student scores

#### Parent Marital Status Impact on Student's Score
- Compared average scores across different marital statuses
- Found minimal impact on academic performance

#### Outlier Detection
- Used boxplots to identify outliers in Math, Reading, and Writing scores
- Math scores showed the highest variability and multiple zero values

#### Ethnic Group Distribution
- Analyzed demographic distribution using pie charts and count plots
- Identified the most represented ethnic groups

## 📈 Key Insights

- Students with parents holding Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees score significantly higher on average
- Parent marital status has negligible impact on exam scores
- Math is the most challenging subject with the widest score spread
- Proper data cleaning is crucial before performing any analysis
- Visualization plays a key role in understanding patterns and trends
